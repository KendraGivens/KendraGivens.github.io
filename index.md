I am an undergraduate computer science student at Middle Tennessee State University. I have previously worked with Dr. Joshua Phillips using transformers to process high throughput DNA sequences. I am excited to be joining Dr. Zackory Erickson's Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction Lab this summer at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy.
